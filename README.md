# 🌐 TCP Client–Server Simulation in C

This project demonstrates a **TCP client–server implementation** in the **C programming language**.  

- 🖥️ Run the **server-side code** on one terminal.  
- 💻 Start the **client-side code** on another terminal.  
- 🔗 The client establishes a connection with the server.  
- 📡 They can then **send and receive data** between each other.  

⚠️ **Note:** This implementation is designed to work **only on Linux** systems.
